                Hello! My name is Fletcher Walmsley! - Welcome to my photo blog! <br/> <br/>
                This is the place for me to share my photos that I think are cool. <br/>
                Generally, they are here because any of the following reasons: <br/>
                They are photographically good, I like the people/place/vibe in them, 
                it is a film photo and I need to post it somewhere to justify paying ~$1.4 per pic! <br/> <br/>
                The decent photos are usually taken on my Sony A6400 and can be found under the 
                <PhotoCamera camera={SONY_CAMERA} contrast="medium" prefetch={false}/> filter.<br/> <br/>
                 My film photos are filtered by films stock and are found under film specific tags, such as: 
                <PhotoFilm film={'kodak-ultramax-400'} type="icon-first"/> or <PhotoFilm film={'fujifilm-200'} type="icon-first"/>.

                <b>About Me:</b> <br/> <br/>
                I&apos;m a Software Developer, based in Christchurch, New Zealand. <br/> 
                I love everything outdoors and attempt to bring a camera of some sorts along with me. <br/> <br/>
                While I love all things tech, my area of expertise is not web development. 
                As such, this website is a lightly modified fork of the excellent exif-photo-blog template by Sam Becker. <br/>
                You can find a link to the template&apos;s Github in the footer of this page. <br/>
