                Hello! My name is Fletcher Walmsley! - Welcome to my photo blog! <br/> <br/>
                This is a place where I add photos I think are cool. <br/>
                The photos I add here are ones I think are photographically good, 
                or because I like the people/place/vibe in them, 
                or because it is a film photo and I need to post somewhere to justify paying ~$1.4 a photo! <br/> <br/>
                The decent pics are usually taken on my Sony A6400 and can be found under the <PhotoCamera camera={SONY_CAMERA} contrast="medium" prefetch={false}/> filter.<br/> <br/>
                Film photos can be found under the <PhotoTag tag="film" contrast="medium" prefetch={false}/> tag.
                Each film photo is also tagged with the film stock used. Such as: <PhotoTag tag="fujifilm-200" contrast="medium" prefetch={false}/>, or <PhotoTag tag="kodak-ultramax-400" contrast="medium" prefetch={false}/>.

                <b>About Me:</b> <br/> <br/>
                I am a Software Developer who is currently based in Christchurch, New Zealand.
                I love everything outdoors and attempt to bring a camera of some sorts along with me. <br/> <br/>
                While I am a Software Engineer, my area of expertise is not in web development.
                So I will not claim to have created this website, but rather forked and modified the excellent exif-photo-blog template by Sam Becker.
